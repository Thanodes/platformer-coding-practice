# Platformer Practice:
 First attempt at coding and creating a 2D sprite game this involves scripts written in C# in Unity
 Notice: All the files have been compressed into ZIP files as they take too much space

# Contents:
- The prefabs: Are the objects that acts as a template from which you can create new Prefab instances in the Scene.
- The scenes: Are the different screens that the game objects will be placed in.
- The scripts: Are the different scripts that control objects and actions within the game such as movement and scene changing (written in C#)
